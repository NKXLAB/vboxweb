# VirtualBox Web Console #

The [VirtualBox Web Console](http://vboxweb.blogspot.com) (VBoxWeb) is an open source project implementing a prototype AJAX version of the popular VirtualBox user interface. As a modern web interface, it allows you to access and control remote VirtualBox instances.

The project is meant to be a proof of concept demonstrating the use of the VirtualBox API from Python and is not designed for production use.

For a powerful and easy to use web interface to VirtualBox, please have a look at [phpVirtualBox](http://code.google.com/p/phpvirtualbox)

VBoxWeb makes use of the following technologies:
  * Oracle VM VirtualBox
  * Python and the VirtualBox Python API
  * VirtualBox RDP Web Control (Flash based RDP client)
  * Prototype (JavaScript library)
  * jQuery and jQuery UI (JavaScript libraries)
